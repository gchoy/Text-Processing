# Text-Processing
Provides basic text file processing. 
Includes scripts that count all the words of a group of files and determines the running mean of these files.

Just download and run using bash run.sh

This program was created using python 3.4.2,
and uses python 3.4.2 standard library modules.

Once the scripts are finished processing all the files in
wc_input folder two lines will be printed:

- wc_result generated
- med_result generated

indicating that result files were created in the output folder.

Any additional input files should have a .txt appended to their name to ensure that they will be processed.
